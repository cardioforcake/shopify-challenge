# Stan Chao | Shopify Intership Challenge

### Deployment

[Deployed Website](https://stanchao-shopifychallenge.netlify.app/)

### Features
- The app will fetch the ten most recent photos from the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day
- The user is able to navigate between the pictures starting with the oldest one.
- The Astronomy Picture of the Day API does not provide the date the picture was captured so the date show on the app is the date that the related picture was featured by NASA.
- The user is able to like pictures by clicking on the heart and unlike the same picture by clicking on the heart again. The heart changes colors depending on whether or not the "like" heart button has been selected.

### Additional / Bonus Features

- The user can select a new date using a drop down calendar. When a new date is selected, the app will fetch ten more pictures starting from the date that was selected and only up to the current date if the current date is less than ten days from the date selected.
- The "liked" status of each photo is saved in the user's local storage and will be remembered across multiple browsing sessions.

### Future Improvements
- Some of the daily photos are actually videos. As it was not required as part of the challenge, I did not embed the video onto the webpage. However, I did create a link that allows the user to naviate to www.youtube.com where the video is hosted.
- Additional styling and animations

### Technologies Used
